# FIST Documentation

**FIST** (For Information and Scheduling of Teams) is a volunteer coordination platform.

This folder has two layers of documentation:

- **Operational guides** for volunteers, leads, metaleads, managers, and admins.
- **Rebuild references** for engineers recreating the system in another stack.

## Source Of Truth Rule

When documentation conflicts with code, treat these as authoritative:

1. `client/router.jsx` and `client/components/RequireAuth.jsx` for route access.
2. `server/methods.js`, `both/methods.js`, and `server/email.js` for server-side behavior.
3. `server/cron.js` and `server/ticketCron.js` for background automation.
4. `both/collections/*.js` for validated local schemas.
5. `imports/fixtures/units-fixtures.js` for default org structure names.

## Audience

- Event organizers and operations teams
- Leads, metaleads, managers, and admins
- Engineers maintaining or migrating the system
- Agents or developers rebuilding this app in a new language/framework
