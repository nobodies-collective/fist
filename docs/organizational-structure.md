## Lead role bootstrapping

Fixture creation inserts lead duties automatically:

- One Meta-Lead duty per department
- One Lead duty per team

It also creates role hierarchy links:

- department role -> parent division role
- team role -> parent department role

## Permission Impact

1. Team leads manage their own team duties/signups.
2. MetaLeads manage department-level operations and oversight.
3. Managers/admins have global scope.

## Operational Notes

- Managers can create departments.
- MetaLeads can create teams.
- Team leads can edit team settings.
- Team move/delete flows exist at department dashboard level in current UI.
