## What Is This Application?

**Volunteers Nowhere** is a volunteer management system built for [Nowhere](https://www.goingnowhere.org/), a participatory arts and community event held annually in Spain. The application helps coordinate hundreds of volunteers who make the event possible.

---

## Who Uses This Application?

### Volunteers
Regular participants who sign up to help with various tasks during the event. They can:
- Create an account and complete their volunteer profile
- Browse available shifts and teams
- Sign up for work shifts during build, event, and strike periods
- View their personal schedule and commitments
- Update their availability and preferences

### Team Leads
Volunteers who coordinate specific teams (e.g., Gate, Sanctuary, Kitchen). They can:
- View and manage their team's shift schedule
- Approve or reject volunteer signups
- See who's signed up for their shifts
- Contact team members
- Export team rotas for planning

### Department Leads (Meta-leads)
Senior volunteers who oversee multiple teams within a department. They can:
- Manage multiple teams under their department
- View department-wide staffing
- Coordinate between team leads
- Access department-level reports

### Managers (Admins)
Event organizers with full system access. They can:
- Configure event settings (dates, periods, requirements)
- Create and manage the organizational structure (divisions, departments, teams)
- Import/export volunteer data
- Manage user accounts and roles
- Access all reports and statistics
- Handle early entry requirements

### NoInfo Leads
Special role for volunteer coordinators who need access to personal information for support purposes. They can:
- View volunteer profiles and contact information
- Check ticket status and attendance
- Access statistics on volunteer participation
- Help with volunteer welfare issues

## Key Features

### Volunteer Signup Flow
1. User creates account with email
2. Verifies email address
3. Completes volunteer profile (experience, skills, dietary needs, emergency contact)
4. Browses available shifts once registration opens (FIST date)
5. Signs up for shifts that fit their schedule
6. Receives confirmation when leads approve signups

### Shift Management
- **Build Period:** Setup shifts before the event
- **Event Period:** During the main event
- **Strike Period:** Teardown shifts after the event
- Shifts have specific times, required skills, and capacity limits

### Early Entry System
Volunteers who complete certain requirements (hours committed, specific roles) can qualify for early entry to help with event setup.

### Team Organization
```
Division (e.g., "Operations")
  └── Department (e.g., "Infrastructure")
        └── Team (e.g., "Power & Lighting")
              └── Shifts (specific work slots)
```

### External Integrations
- **Fistbump:** Ticket verification system - validates that volunteers have valid event tickets
- **Quicket:** Historical ticketing integration (deprecated)

## Core Concepts

### Event Periods
The event is divided into distinct periods:
- **Build:** 1-2 weeks before the main event, setting up infrastructure
- **Event:** The main event itself (typically 1 week)
- **Strike:** Teardown period after the event

### Shift Types
- **Shifts:** Fixed-time work slots (e.g., "Gate 8am-12pm")
- **Projects:** Flexible tasks without strict times
- **Rotas:** Recurring shift patterns

### User Roles
Managed via `alanning:roles` package with event-scoped permissions:
- `admin` - Full system access
- `manager` - Event management
- `noinfo` - Volunteer welfare access
- Team/department IDs as roles for leads

### FIST Date
"FIST Open Date" - when volunteer signup opens to the general public. Before this date, only leads and managers can access the system.

---

## Data Privacy

This application handles personal information including:
- Contact details (email, emergency contacts)
- Dietary requirements and allergies
- Medical conditions
- Ticket/attendance information

**Important:** The application falls under GDPR regulations. See `SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md` for current compliance status and required improvements.

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Hybrid UI:** Currently transitioning from Blaze to React - some features use legacy technology
2. **React Version:** Using React 16 (end-of-life), upgrade blocked by Blaze dependencies
3. **Mobile:** Basic responsive design, no dedicated mobile app
4. **Offline:** Requires internet connection, no offline mode

---

## Contributing

The core volunteer management logic is in a separate package ([meteor-volunteers](https://github.com/goingnowhere/meteor-volunteers)) designed to be reusable by other events. Contributions to both repositories are welcome.

### Code Style
- ESLint with Airbnb base configuration
- No semicolons
- 2-space indentation
- React hooks rules enforced

### Before Contributing
1. Read `CLAUDE.md` for development guidance
2. Review `SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md` for known issues
3. Check `TODO_PRIORITIZED.md` for planned work
